                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>"Data collection" in data analysis refers to the process of gathering 
                    information or raw data from various sources, like internal company databases, external sources, surveys, 
                    or web scraping, which is the first crucial step for a data analyst to analyze and interpret to answer 
                    specific questions or make informed business decisions. Essentially, it's the act of acquiring the data needed to perform analysis.</p>

            <div class="capability-card">
                <h3>Data Cleansing</h3>
                <p>"Data cleaning" in data analysis refers to the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing information within a dataset,
                    ensuring the data is accurate and ready for further analysis by removing irrelevant data, fixing formatting issues, handling duplicates,
                    and managing outliers. Essentially making the data "clean" and reliable for drawing meaningful insights.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="capability-card">
                <h3>Data standardization</h3>
                <p>"Data standardization" in the context of data analysis, is the process of transforming data from various sources into a consistent, uniform format,
                    ensuring all data elements adhere to predefined rules like naming conventions, formatting, and categorization, which allows for easier integration,
                    analysis, and interpretation across different datasets. Essentially, it's about making sure all data "speaks the same language" to avoid inconsistencies and improve data quality for reliable insights.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="capability-card">
                <h3>Data visualization</h3>
                <p>"Data visualization" refers to the practice of using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps to represent complex data sets, 
                    making patterns and trends easier to understand and communicate effectively to audiences, especially non-technical stakeholders, 
                    by visually presenting insights extracted from the data analysis process.</p>

                    <h3>Youtube Perfomance analytics</h3>
                    <p>This project is an analysis of a YouTube account over the period from 2016 to 2024. In this project,
                        I used the Kaggle website environment to obtain the dataset, Microsoft Excel for data cleansing/standardization, 
                        and Tableau Public for data visualization. There are actually many types of analyses that can be derived from this 
                        dataset, depending on the company's requirements. Since this is a portfolio project, I used a case study to conduct 
                        analysis and visualization on this dataset.</p>
